# rc_rover
The goal of this project is to design and prototype an RC rover that can move in all directions to explore terrain. A rover is used to collect information and samples from a specific terrain. They are used by lots of companies, especially those focused on space or deep-sea exploration. Some specifications that we might need to consider are: size, weight, material, and pressure resistance.


Meeting 1:
Date: 03/12/23
Time: 9:15 - 12 PM

Reference Material: https://ecetechprojects.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/arduino-h-bridge-motor-control/

Finalized Proposal: https://1drv.ms/w/s!At5nmv7gLyVwkvE4l1jkQC4PCUBfSg?e=4K8k71

Discussed the H-Bridge Design and decided which parts would be used
  - Decided on using PNP transistors
  - 9V battery
  - DC motors
  
Went through the schematic and calculated how much current it could handle

Defined and divided up the tasks
